# InstacartPython
CareerFoundry data analytics course basket analysis project using Instacart data.

Instacart is an existing online grocery store that operates through an app. In this theoretical project, I was hired by Instacart to uncover more information about their sales patterns to increase profits and to improve already good sales. I conducted a review of the intial data and an exploratory analysis to derive insights and recommend strategies for these goals.

I used open-source data sets from Instacart and utilized created customer data to address key questions, clean and analyze data, and create visualizations.

Technical skills
-> Use of Python and relevant libraries to conduct analyses including pandas, NumPy, and os. Cleaning and querying data was conducted primarily in Jupyter notebooks and Spyder.

-> Visualizations were also created in Python using relevant libraries: matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn.
